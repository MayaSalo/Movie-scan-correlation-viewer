# Movie-scan-correlation-viewer

This code visualizes neural pattern correlation matrices alongside a video stimulus. It allows users to interactively explore averaged time bins from a movie and inspect their corresponding positions in a time-point-by-time-point correlation matrix.
It allows the examination of specific scenes as they are divided by the brain (data-driven division).

## Main goal:
When working on neural data from movie watching, we eant to understand more about how the brain encodes the movie. This visualization will help us learn about the movie frames/ scenes that were calculated similarly/differently in the brain (in a given region of interest).

## Features

Loads a full movie (e.g., .mp4) and a precomputed correlation matrix (e.g., .mat).

Averages frames over specified time bins (default: 2.01 seconds).

Computes a population vector correlation matrix from the neural data. 

Aligns bins to start after a specific time point (default: from the 3rd bin).

## Displays:

Left panel: the averaged movie frame for the current time bin.

Right panel: the correlation matrix, with a vertical line indicating the selected bin.

Interactive slider to explore time bins manually.

Progress and navigation messages printed to the MATLAB Command Window.

## Inputs

Movie file: Any standard format (e.g., .mp4), readable via VideoReader.

Neural activity: a 2D matrix of neural activity with dimensions: [voxels Ã— TRs].


## Running the code:

python movie_time_bin_viewer.py

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python scipy
